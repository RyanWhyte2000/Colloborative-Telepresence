		<li> <h2> What is Collaborative Telepresence? </h2> </li>
			<p> <i> "This tele-presence feeling is achieved by visually registering the head-mounted display of the local user to the remote world and by dynamically registerin the local object both visually and haptically with respect to the remote world." </i>

			This was taken from a research article done by Ansar, Desai Daniilidis , Kumar and Rodrigues about how collaborative telepresence has brought forward a large change as it relates to visual and haptics.
			<br> In layman's term, Collaborative Telepresence
			refers to group of persons that are not necessarily in the same geographical location coming together to achieve a common goal/task as if they were right beside each other. </p>

		<li><h2> History Of Collaborative Telepresence </h2> </li>
		
			<p> Ever since the introduction of Arpanet or the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network in the late 1960's  by the U.S. Department Of Justice, the term 'Collaborative Telepresence' can said to be originated as Arpanet allowed multiple computer to communicate
			with each other on a global platform. The later innovation of the world wide web allowed for accessing information or data online in the form of websites. The world wide web allowed for persons to become more familiarized with the internet. The difference between the internet and 
			the world wide web is that web is a collection of information while the internet is what is used to access the web to gain the information. The internet allowed for many persons to interact with each other and is said to be the main reason why collaborative telepresence	
			has dominated or greatly impact many industries in today's world.</p>
