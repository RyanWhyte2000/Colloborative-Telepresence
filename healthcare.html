	<p> Imagine doctors conducting a heart transplant even though they are not in the same same physical location.
	Collaborative Telepresence provides an oppurtunity for this to take place. The introduction of mobile application
	has eliminate the need for patients to visit the doctor to get a check up. These mobile applications can provide access 
	to drug information to help prevent side effects and interactions, solve problems, and improve diagnosis, allows Doctors to
	communicate directly with their patients, record their vital signs accurately, maintain logs about visits and consultations,
	and achieve greater procedural efficiency. <br>
	
	Telemedicine, a term that was introduced as a result of collaborative Telepresence. Like the mobile app, it allows
	for patient to communicate with doctors accross the world. This is very useful in extreme emergency situations. 
	Telemedicine has features such as video calling and devices which allows bi signals and recording to be transfered to
	physicians to make diagnosis. This reduce waiting time and speed up the treatment delivery process.
