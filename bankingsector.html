	<p> Collaborative Telepresence in the banking sector has arrived in the form of online banking and smart ATMs.
		Online Banking refers to the conduction of banking related activities, such as transfer of money, filing of loans, paying bills and deposit checks,
		over the internet. With calloborative telepresence in the banking sector, customers and banking officials don't have to be 
		at the bank to conduct any form of transaction. Online banking provides the ability for customers to manage their money online. It also reduce cost, as 
		there is no need to go the bank.</p>
